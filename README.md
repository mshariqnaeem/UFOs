# UFOs

Using Javascript to create a web page, learn new functions within Javascript such as arrow functions, and create a dynamic table which can be filtered by the user!

## Overview

Dana has learned how to use HTML webpage's and also how to create dynamic tables within the webpage. She wants to take this a step further by allowing the user to filter data and multiple criteria to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. She wants the user to be able to filter the city, state country and shape in the results. For this purpose we have decided to help Dana with the new skills we have learned

## Results

As shown in the picture below, we have helped Dana build a webpage on UFO sightings.

### Dynamic Table with data filters

In addition to the creation of the website we have also created a dynamic table with filters that Dana wanted users to help manipulate their searches (city, state, country, shape). The filters can be seen in the image below on the left hand side. On the right hand side we see the total results of the unfiltered data

### Filters in use

Now to show the filters in use we will use an example which is displayed below. When we filter the data by typing in the date of 1/1/2010 and the shape as Sphere we see how the table filters the data to show the results of these 2 specific search terms. In this specific case the search comes up with 5 results.

## Summary

### Original Website drawbacks and recommendations

A thing to take into consideration of the original website and table was that there was no button to clear the data filters and the user of the table would need to remember to manually clear the filters. As this is something a person may be easily able to forget we have added a button to clear the data as shown in the picture below.

This filter button can be accomplished in 2 ways. 1 of which is to create a function to clear the data called clearClick or to create a button in HTML

an image of the clearClick function in javascript is shown below.
